A thing for the PE office.

### What is this?
Computer Science Advanced Studies requires a project to be done in the field of your study each semester. As a project for User Interface Design, I am creating a project for the PE office. It will allow coaches to add, delete, and edit semesters and periods of their students. These students will then be able to log their workouts for the coaches to view. It will also automatically calculate the weights each student should be lifting. Finally, coaches will have a screen to project during the student's period.

### Is it done yet?
Probably!

### Can I use this for anything?
Yes, as long as you credit me.

### How do I set this up on my own website?
You probably shouldn't.
